CONTEXT AND DEFINITIONS:
- SIFP (Simple Function Point): A functional size measurement method for software that assigns numeric values based on user functional requirements.
- UGEP (Unspecified Generic Elementary Process): An atomic set of functional user requirements conceived for processing purposes. It refers to an informational or operational goal considered significant and unitary by the user and includes all automated, mandatory and optional activities needed to meet the goal. After a UGEP is concluded, the MSA to which it belongs must be in a logically consistent state.
- UGDG (Unspecified Generic Data Group): An atomic set of user requirements having a storage purpose. It refers to a single logical data set of interest to the user, for which information must be kept persistently.
- MSA (Measurable Software Application): An aggregate of logical features based on the business and identified from the point of view of its users, of their goals and informational and operational needs.
- ADD: New functionality being added to the software.
- CHG: Existing functionality being modified.
- DEL: Existing functionality being removed.
- AUX: Supporting/auxiliary functionality.
- DEV (Development): Creating a new MSA from scratch.
- FEM (Functional Enhancement Maintenance): Modifying an existing MSA by adding, changing, or deleting functionality.

RULES FROM SPECIFICATION:
1. Identify UGEP (Unspecified Generic Elementary Process)
   - Weight: 4.6 SIFP points
   - Must be atomic/elementary (cannot be further decomposed while maintaining its functional purpose)
   - Must achieve a complete business goal (not a partial process)
   - Must leave the system in a logically consistent state
   - Includes all mandatory and optional activities needed to achieve the goal
   - Classification types:
     * ADD (4.6): New functionality being added
     * CHG (4.6): Existing functionality being modified
     * DEL (4.6): Existing functionality being removed
     * AUX (4.6): Supporting/auxiliary processes

2. Identify UGDG (Unspecified Generic Data Group)
   - Weight: 7.0 SIFP points
   - Must be fundamental data (not auxiliary/technical)
   - Must require persistent storage (beyond a single transaction)
   - Must be atomic/elementary (a single logical data set)
   - Must serve business purpose (relevant to user requirements)
   - Classification types:
     * ADD (7.0): New data groups being added
     * CHG (7.0): Existing data groups being modified
     * DEL (7.0): Existing data groups being removed
     * AUX (7.0): Supporting/auxiliary data groups

3. Apply Measurement Rules
   - Development (DEV): DEV SiFP = ADD + AUX
   - Asset after development: MSA SiFP = ADD
   - Enhancement (FEM): FEM SiFP = ADD + CHG + DEL + AUX
   - Asset after enhancement: MSA SiFP after = MSA SiFP before + ADD - DEL
   - Each UGEP/UGDG must be classified as ADD, CHG, DEL, or AUX
   - Count each unique UGEP/UGDG only once (no duplicates)

CALCULATION RULES:
1. Each UGEP contributes exactly 4.6 points to its category (ADD/CHG/DEL/AUX)
2. Each UGDG contributes exactly 7.0 points to its category (ADD/CHG/DEL/AUX)
3. Calculate total points by:
   - ADD points = (Number of ADD UGEPs x 4.6) + (Number of ADD UGDGs x 7.0)
   - CHG points = (Number of CHG UGEPs x 4.6) + (Number of CHG UGDGs x 7.0)
   - DEL points = (Number of DEL UGEPs x 4.6) + (Number of DEL UGDGs x 7.0)
   - AUX points = (Number of AUX UGEPs x 4.6) + (Number of AUX UGDGs x 7.0)
   - Total points = ADD + CHG + DEL + AUX
4. All point values must be numeric decimals in the output JSON
5. Do not include calculations or formulas in the output

UNIQUENESS RULES:
1. Two UGEPs are identical when they process the same data in the same way and could be used interchangeably.
2. Two UGDGs are identical when they refer to the same object of interest to the user.
3. Each unique UGEP or UGDG should be counted only once, regardless of how many times it appears in the requirements.
4. A UGEP which has the same computational behavior on the same data as another, and differs only by the technology used, or by the platform used, is considered identical and must be listed only once.

ANALYSIS STEPS:
1. Read the requirement carefully to understand the context and purpose
2. Identify all UGEPs (processing-oriented components) that fulfill a complete business goal
3. Identify all UGDGs (data-oriented components) that require persistent storage
4. Classify each UGEP and UGDG as ADD, CHG, DEL, or AUX
5. Eliminate duplicates based on uniqueness rules
6. Calculate SIFP points using fixed weights (UGEP = 4.6, UGDG = 7.0)
7. Provide justification for each identification and classification

     * Fundamental data nature
     * Persistent storage requirement
     * Atomic logical data set
     * Weight = 7.0 points
   - Classification consistency:
     * ADD: New components
     * CHG: Modified existing components
     * DEL: Removed existing components
     * AUX: Supporting/auxiliary components
   - Formula correctness:
     * Development (DEV): DEV SiFP = ADD + AUX
     * Asset after development: MSA SiFP = ADD
     * Enhancement (FEM): FEM SiFP = ADD + CHG + DEL + AUX
     * Asset after enhancement: MSA SiFP after = MSA SiFP before + ADD - DEL

3. Consistency Enforcement
   - Uniform application of identification criteria
   - Consistent weight assignment (UGEP = 4.6, UGDG = 7.0)
   - Standardized calculation methodology
   - Equitable treatment of similar components
   - Balanced evaluation of multiple judgments
   - Coherent final estimation

META-JUDGE PROCESS:
1. Review the original requirement thoroughly
2. Analyze all provided judgments in detail
3. Assess each judgment against SIFP principles
4. Identify inconsistencies, errors, or ambiguities
5. Determine the most accurate judgment or synthesize from multiple judgments
6. Validate final component identification and classification
7. Verify final calculation correctness
8. Provide comprehensive reasoning for meta-judgment
9. Assign a final score, confidence level, and validity indicator

SCORING GUIDELINES:

CALCULATION VALIDATION RULES:
1. Verify all point values are numeric decimals, not formulas
2. Confirm UGEP points are exactly 4.6 each
3. Confirm UGDG points are exactly 7.0 each
4. Ensure totals are pre-calculated sums, not expressions
5. All point values in final_estimation must be numeric decimals

Example valid final estimation:
{
    "sifp_points": {
        "add": 16.2,  // Not "2*4.6 + 7.0"
        "chg": 4.6,   // Not "1*4.6"
        "del": 0.0,
        "aux": 7.0,   // Not "1*7.0"
        "total": 27.8 // Not "16.2 + 4.6 + 0.0 + 7.0"
    }
}

CRITICAL RESPONSE FORMATTING RULES:
1. Your output MUST be a raw JSON object ONLY, with no additional text
2. DO NOT wrap your response in Markdown code blocks (```json ... ```)
3. DO NOT include explanations, analysis, or any text outside the JSON structure
4. Start your response with the opening brace { and end with the closing brace }
5. All analysis must be contained within the JSON structure fields
6. Include all required fields in the output JSON
7. Ensure all numeric values are valid decimal numbers
8. Do not include any text before or after the JSON object
9. DO NOT include any comments in the JSON (like "// explanation" or "/* comment */")
10. Ensure the JSON is standard-compliant without trailing commas or comments"""
